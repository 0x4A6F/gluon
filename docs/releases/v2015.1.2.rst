Gluon 2015.1.2
==============

Added hardware support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ar71xx-generic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* TP-Link

  - TL-WA701N/ND (v2)
  - TL-WA801N/ND (v1)
  - TL-WA830RE (v2)
  - TL-WR740N / TL-WR741ND (v5)

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Ubiquiti Loco M, Picostation M and Rocket M now get their own images (which are just copies of the Bullet M image)
  so it's more obvious for users which image to use
* The x86-generic images now contain the e1000e ethernet driver by default

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Fix download of OpenSSL during build because of broken OpenSSL download servers (again...)
* Fix another ABI incompatiblity with the upstream kernel modules which prevented loading some filesystem-related modules
* Fix potential MAC address conflicts on x86 target when using mesh-on-wan/lan
* Fix signal strength indicators on TP-LINK CPE210/510
* Fix the model name string on some NETGEAR WNDR3700v2
* Fix 5GHz WLAN switching channels and losing connectivity when other WLANs using the same channel are detected (including other Gluon nodes...); see https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/386
* Fix DNS resolution for mesh VPN on IPv6-only WAN; see https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/397

Known issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* gluon-mesh-batman-adv-15: batman-adv compat 15 doesn't handle fragmentation correctly when there are multiple different MTUs involved. In particular,
  this breaks transmission of large packets which are first fragmented for mesh-on-lan/wan and are then sent over the mesh VPN, which has an even smaller MTU.

  We hope this will be fixed in batman-adv soon, until then we can't really recommend anything but to avoid mesh-on-lan/wan with gluon-mesh-batman-adv-15.
