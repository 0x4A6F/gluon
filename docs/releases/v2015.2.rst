* ``i18n/``

  - The translations of ``gluon-config-mode:pubkey`` now have to show the fastd
    public key itself if desired, making its format and whether it is shown at
    all configurable. To retain the old format, add ``<p>`` to the beginning of
    your translations and append::

    "</p>"
    "<div class=\"the-key\">"
    " # <%= hostname %>"
    " <br/>"
    "<%= pubkey %>"
    "</div>"
