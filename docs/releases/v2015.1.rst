Gluon 2015.1 (in development)
=============================

Added (and removed) hardware support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~


Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~


Site changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ``site.conf``

  - ``hostname_prefix`` is now optional, and is concatenated directly with the
    generated node ID, in particular no hyphen is inserted anymore. If you want
    to keep the old behaviour, you have to append the hyphen to the
    ``hostname_prefix`` field of your ``site.conf``.

* ``site.mk``

  - The packages ``gluon-setup-mode`` and ``gluon-config-mode-core`` must now be
    added to ``GLUON_SITE_PACKAGES`` explicitly (to allow replacing them with
    community-specific implementations).
